# CShark 🦈

  At first, this project was started with the name of Embargo Breaker.

  During a rewrite, it was decided to change the name of the program to Shield, and now you have a completely advanced version of CShark.

  With CShark, internet sanctions in Iran (at least) are bypassed. 

  Currently, it is a pre-release version and it is not stable, but a stable release will be provided soon...
