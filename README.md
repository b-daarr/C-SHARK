# CShark 🦈

At first, this project was started with the name of Embargo Breaker.

During a rewrite, it was decided to change the name of the program to Shield, and now you have a completely advanced version of CShark.

With CShark, internet sanctions in Iran (at least) are bypassed. 

Currently, it is a release version and it is not stable, but a stable release will be provided soon.\

+ Any imitation and copy of the CShark sourcewill be prosecuted! (Forking and helping to develop the project is your favor so that we can progress togather 🙏🏻).
### + Hoping to build an information free and fair world :)
