~ At first, this project was started with the name of Embargo Breaker.

During a rewrite, it was decided to change the name of the program to Shield, and now you have a completely advanced
version of CShark Space.

With C-SHARK, internet sanctions in Iran (at least) are bypassed.

+ Currently, it is a pre-release version and it is not stable, but a stable release will be provided soon...
Forking and helping to develop the project is your favor so that we can progress togather 🙏🏻.
  I am interested in your suggestions or providing important points from you.
